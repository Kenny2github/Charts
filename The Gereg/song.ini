loading_phrase=The Gereg was a diplomatic passport given by Genghis Khan that permitted a messenger to easily cross boundaries so as to forward his orders. The Hu hope that their music will act like a Gereg for Mongolia in the world, and the Mongolian government has indeed named them official representatives of Mongolia.
