loading_phrase="Yuve yuve yu" is Mongolian for "How strange, how strange". The song's lyrics overall are rather nationalist, calling for Mongols to rise up and wipe the ashes off their ancestors' graves. What's certainly the case is that the Mongols are taking over the world again, this time with their metal.
