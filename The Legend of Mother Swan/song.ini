loading_phrase = This is a tale of the power of a mother's love for their offspring. Mongolians deeply respect their mothers because they are the reason we're here on earth. This song tells a story how a mother swan protects and saves her babies by sacrificing her own life. This message should be shared with everyone in this modern world.
